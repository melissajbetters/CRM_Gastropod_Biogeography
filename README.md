# CRM_Gastropod_Biogeography

This repository houses the data files used to generate statistics and figures for the paper entitled "Phylogeographic context of gastropod limpets from the Costa Rica Margin" authored by Melissa Betters. 

All files labelled [Genus]_AllSequences.fas were used to generate haplotype figures and statistics, as well as to calculate genetic distances used in the isolation-by-distance testing.

All files labelled [Genus]_latlon.csv, [Genus]_DepthDifferences.csv, and [Genus]_GeneticDistances.csv were used to conduct the isolation-by-distance tests. The R code file in this repository shows how these files were used to conduct these statistical tests.
